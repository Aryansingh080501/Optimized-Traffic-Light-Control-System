# Optimized-Traffic-Light-Control-System

## Project Overview
This project aims to optimize traffic flow through intersections by developing an adjustable timing scheme for traffic lights, enhancing the functionality of traditional timer-based and detection-based systems.

## Key Features
- **Adaptive Traffic Light Control**: Utilizes traffic data to dynamically adjust the light cycle, prioritizing higher traffic areas.
- **Verilog Programming**: Implemented the traffic light functionality using Verilog, including a custom timer module, traffic light control (TLC) module, and testbench.
- **Synthesis for Hardware Implementation**: Translated HDL code into a gate netlist, optimizing for area, power, and timing.

## Project Goals
- Ensure efficient traffic management by detecting vehicle flow and adjusting light timings.
- Handle state transitions based on traffic presence, with custom logic for green light prioritization.
